<!-- Describe your project in brief -->

The project title should be self-explanatory and try not to make it a mouthful. (Although exceptions exist- **awesome-readme-writing-guide-for-open-source-projects** - would have been a cool name)

# Demo-Preview
<!-- Add a demo for your project -->
Here is demo of the final resualts I got in this project

# Installation
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

*You might have noticed the **Back to top** button(if not, please notice, it's right there!). This is a good idea because it makes your README **easy to navigate.*** 

The first one should be how to install(how to generally use your project or set-up for editing in their machine).

This should give the users a concrete idea with instructions on how they can use your project repo with all the steps.

Following this steps, **they should be able to run this in their device.**

A method I use is after completing the README, I go through the instructions from scratch and check if it is working.

Here is a sample instruction:

To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the command below:

```git init```

```git clone https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter.git```

# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This is optional and it is used to give the user info on how to use the project after installation. This could be added in the Installation section also.

# Footer
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Let's also add a footer because I love footers and also you **can** use this to convey important info.

Let's make it an image because by now you have realised that multimedia in images == cool(*please notice the subtle programming joke).

So that is it... You have completed your training young grasshopper. Now it is time for you to use this ideas for your projects.

Don't forget your **README Sensei**(*cool twitter handle idea*) when your project takes off with your **Awesome README**.
