<!-- Describe your project in brief -->

The project title should be self-explanatory and try not to make it a mouthful. (Although exceptions exist- **awesome-readme-writing-guide-for-open-source-projects** - would have been a cool name)

Add a cover/banner image for your README. **Why?** Because it easily **grabs people's attention** and it **looks cool**(*duh!obviously!*).

Wait, I forgot something. You can use this README as a template from [this link](README-template.md).

The best dimensions for the banner is **1280x650px**. You could also use this for social preview of your repo.

I personally use [**Canva**](https://www.canva.com/) for creating the banner images. All the basic stuff is **free**(*you won't need the pro version in most cases*).

# Demo-Preview
<!-- Add a demo for your project -->

After you have written about your project, it is a good idea to have a demo/preview(**video/gif/screenshots** are good options) of your project so that people can know what to expect in your project. You could also add the demo in the previous section with the product description.

Here is a random GIF as a placeholder.

# Table of contents

After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README.

- [Project Title](#project-title)
- [Demo-Preview](#demo-preview)
- [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Development](#development)
- [Contribute](#contribute)
    - [Sponsor](#sponsor)
    - [Adding new features or fixing bugs](#adding-new-features-or-fixing-bugs)
- [License](#license)
- [Footer](#footer)

# Installation
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

*You might have noticed the **Back to top** button(if not, please notice, it's right there!). This is a good idea because it makes your README **easy to navigate.*** 

The first one should be how to install(how to generally use your project or set-up for editing in their machine).

This should give the users a concrete idea with instructions on how they can use your project repo with all the steps.

Following this steps, **they should be able to run this in their device.**

A method I use is after completing the README, I go through the instructions from scratch and check if it is working.

Here is a sample instruction:

To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the command below:

```git init```

```git clone https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter.git```

# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This is optional and it is used to give the user info on how to use the project after installation. This could be added in the Installation section also.

# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This is the place where you give instructions to developers on how to modify the code.

You could give **instructions in depth** of **how the code works** and how everything is put together.

You could also give specific instructions to how they can setup their development environment.

Ideally, you should keep the README simple. If you need to add more complex explanations, use a wiki. Check out [this wiki](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/wiki) for inspiration.

# License
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Adding the license to README is a good practice so that people can easily refer to it.

Make sure you have added a LICENSE file in your project folder. **Shortcut:** Click add new file in your root of your repo in GitHub --> Set file name to LICENSE --> GitHub shows LICENSE templates ---> Choose the one that best suits your project!

I personally add the name of the license and provide a link to it like below.

[GNU General Public License version 3](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0)

# Footer
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Let's also add a footer because I love footers and also you **can** use this to convey important info.

Let's make it an image because by now you have realised that multimedia in images == cool(*please notice the subtle programming joke).

So that is it... You have completed your training young grasshopper. Now it is time for you to use this ideas for your projects.

Don't forget your **README Sensei**(*cool twitter handle idea*) when your project takes off with your **Awesome README**.

Leave a star in GitHub, give a clap in Medium and share this guide if you found this helpful.

**Now folks, the moment you've all been waiting for! The footer!**
***[Audible gasp]***
